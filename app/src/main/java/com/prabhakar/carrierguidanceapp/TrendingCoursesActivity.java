        courses.put("Cybersecurity Fundamentals", "Cybersecurity Fundamentals involve the practices and principles that protect systems, networks, and data from cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and damage. Cybersecurity encompasses a range of techniques designed to safeguard computers, networks, programs, and data from cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, malware, and data breaches. The primary goals of cybersecurity are confidentiality, integrity, and availabilityâ€”ensuring that data is kept secure, remains accurate, and is accessible when needed. Key components of cybersecurity include network security, information security, application security, endpoint security, and identity and access management. Network security protects the integrity of networks and data as they are transmitted, while information security focuses on securing sensitive data from unauthorized access or alteration. Application security ensures that software applications are designed to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, and endpoint security safeguards devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets from malicious threats. Identity and access management ensures that only authorized users have access to specific systems or data. Cybersecurity tools and techniques include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. A robust cybersecurity strategy often involves risk management, threat assessment, and incident response plans to detect, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks. Best practices for cybersecurity include regularly updating software, using strong passwords, backing up critical data, and educating users about security risks. Cybersecurity is vital across industries, including finance, healthcare, government, and e-commerce, to protect sensitive information, maintain trust, and ensure business continuity. With the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks, cybersecurity is becoming an essential part of modern digital infrastructure, requiring constant vigilance, innovation, and adaptation to emerging threats.");
